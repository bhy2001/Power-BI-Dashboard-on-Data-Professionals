<h1>Power BI Dashboard on Data Professionals</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This is a Power BI Project using a particular dataset, to gain further insights about said dataset as well as to practice Power BI fundamentals.</p>

<p>In this project, I utilized Power Query to efficiently streamline and consolidate insights from a comprehensive survey conducted with over 600 participants. These participants, representing data professionals from more than five countries, provided valuable information on various aspects of their roles, responsibilities, and experiences within the data industry</p>

<p>By employing Power Query, I was able to systematically clean, transform, and aggregate the survey data, ensuring accuracy and consistency across the diverse dataset. This process involved meticulous data preparation, which included handling inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to create a unified and reliable dataset for analysis.</p>

<p>With the refined dataset in hand, I then leveraged PowerBI to create a series of impactful visualizations. These visualizations included a mix of gauge charts, donut charts, column charts, bar charts, and Treemaps, each designed to highlight specific insights and trends within the data. The combination of these visual elements allowed for a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of the survey results.</p>

<p>The details can be broken down to several key points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Data Collection and Consolidation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I employed Power Query to streamline and consolidate insights from a survey involving over 600 participants across various countries.</li>
      <li>The survey likely covered topics related to data professions, gathering valuable information about trends, preferences, and challenges faced by professionals in this field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <h3>Visualization Creation with Power BI</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I constructed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI and its features.</li>
      <li>The dashboard likely includes various visualizations such as gauge, donut, column, bar charts, and Treemaps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this project demonstrates a thorough understanding of data processing, visualization, and insights generation. Itâ€™s an example of leveraging tools like Power Query and Power BI to extract meaningful information from large datasets</p>
